\section{Audio frameworks}
In this part we will discuss several frameworks used for audio processing.
HARK will be discussed in greater detail.
The four other frameworks we will discuss here, namely JACK, ALSA, Pulseaudio and Gstreamer are similar enough to JACK to justify just discussing their differences to JACK.

\subsubsection{HARK}
HARK is a modular framework with explicit focus on integrating beamforming and speech recognition solutions, developed by a team of researcher centered around Kyoto University. %TODO cite
Its goal is to provide an all in one solution for audition in robots specifically.


- HARK is modular as it provides several algorithms (or nodes) for each processing step, i.e. SSL, beamforming and speech recognition.

- Information gathered by these nodes can be extracted rather easily.

- It does, however, not provide any nodes for information extraction apart from that.

- Neither does it provide algorithms for other audio processing tasks such as gender or emotion recognition.

- Synchronization of any such information is therefore also unsupported.

- HARK will mostly not transfer audio data, but frequency data.
This results in a quite TODO (aus kleinen teilen bestehend) nodes, 




\subsubsection{JACK}
- The Jack audio connection kit \cite{JACK} is a protocol for audio transmission between components with the explicit requirement for a low latency, to enable real time capture, playback and editing of sound. 

- JACK does not allow for additional information to transmitted with the raw audio it transports, so any additionally information must be transmitted and synchronized separately with another middleware. 

- JACK is able to transmit audio over network, but generally requires all participating computers to run an instance of the same server implementation. 

- JACK requires all components which use its API to process audio in a specific and rather short time. 
Audio is written to and read from JACK via buffers, which will be in turn read and written by JACK in specific intervals.
If a component is not able to read or produce audio fast enough, JACK will overwrite or read old audio respectively, so audio is lost. 
This is important for applications which result in humans hearing the transmitted audio directly, to reduce latency and negate long or at least noticeable periods of silence.

\subsection{Gstreamer}

Gstreamer \cite{Gstreamer}

\subsection{ALSA}
The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) 
It provides drivers and access to hardware sound sources and sinks, typically -but not limited to- microphones and speakers.

\begin{itemize}
	\item de facto standard on every linux machine, but available on several other operating systems
	\item provides access to hardware sound sources and sinks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PulseAudio}

\subsection{Closing remarks}
Most of the presented frameworks can be used alongside each other, as they oftentimes have interfaces for each other. 
A combination of the presented frameworks may come to mind but most of the discussed problems will just add up instead of cancel each other out.
