\chapter{Evaluation}

In this chapter, two experiments will be presented which were used to evaluate the proposed speech recognition pipeline.
First, different configurations of the proposed speech recognition pipeline will be compared against each other and against a baseline in the form of an already existing solution.
This test will focus on performance and computational cost.
Second, a configuration of the proposed pipeline will be compared against an existing solution in a slightly altered RoboCup@Home Speech- \& Person Recognition task with focus on sound source localization results and their fusion with speech recognition results.
