\chapter{Related Work}

In this chapter a number of related projects and research findings will be presented and discussed. 
Several directions will be explored, e.g. existing audio frameworks to transport audio \& create audio processing pipelines and different approaches to fusion of information.
Lastly RoboCup@Home, a competition between domestic robots with a strong research focus will be discussed, and we will take a look into synchronization and fusion methods of several RoboCup@Home teams.
