\chapter{Reproducibility}

\section{Source Code}
The source code for this thesis lies in a rather vast number of git repositories.
All of these repositories are open source.
Following is a list of all repositories used in this thesis and their respective location:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[bla] blubb
\end{itemize}


\section{Build instructions}
Due to the number of components used in this thesis and the fact that each of them is embedded in their own git repository, building this source code can be a bit challenging.
To alleviate this, we created a distribution in the RDTK (TODO cite + explain)
To first bootstrap the RDTK, follow their tutorial\footnote{\url{https://toolkit.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/tutorials/bootstrapping}}.
Afterwards you can install the distribution named ''speechrec-pipeline'', again following their tutorial\footnote{\url{https://toolkit.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/tutorials/installing}}.


Building is supported for Ubuntu 18.04 and 16.04, though under 16.04 an additional library has to be build from hand\footnote{This is documented within the README file of the project in question under \url{https://github.com/Slothologist/esiaf_ros/}}.
